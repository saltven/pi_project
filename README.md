# To run
This project is a web app that displays the value of PI and the circumference of the sun. There are two folders to run. To interact with the web app, you need to run the server-side folder first then the client-side after.

Make sure you have Node installed on your local machine.

#1 Install node_modules `npm i` in both folders.

#2 `npm start` in server-side folder and then in client-side folder. The server needs to run first in order to return the PI value to the web app.

The server-side will run on `localhost:3001` and the client-side will run on `localhost:3001`

That's it! Thank you ðŸ˜Š
